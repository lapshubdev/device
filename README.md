### Hardware Components
1. Rasbperry Pi zero W 2. 
2. [Berry GPS-IMU V4](https://ozzmaker.com/product/berrygps-imu). You can also obtain different GPS hats which might be already compatible with this software (look at GPS hat drivers in "./libs/gps" directory).
3. GPS Antenna - 32db High Gain Cirocomm 5cm Active GPS Antenna Ceramic Antenna 25x25x2mm Geekstory
4. ZTE MF833V 4G LTE USB Modem Dongle for data.
5. Case - UniPiCase Pi Zero Case - Tall (Stock Faceplate)
6. [Suction Cup](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YJJSCLX?psc=1&ref=product_details)

### Assembly
1. Install the Berry GPS hat onto the Raspberry Pi0. Soldering is required for getting the hat attached to it.

2. Obtain the GPS floor either by ordering it from the Racetrack Hero store, or by printing it yourself from the following CAD file.
3. Attach the GPS floor onto the top of the stack.
4. Attach the GPS antenna onto the previously printed/obtained GPS floor.
5. Attach the suction cups into the shell.
6. Glue all thing together, being generous, at the end of the day this will be on your winshield.
7. Insert the GPS angled connector into the mini USB on PI0, and connect the ZTE modem. Angle it like on this picture, glue it all together.



## Touchscreen Device with bigger screen

### Hardware Components
1. Raspberry Pi 4
2. [Berry GPS-IMU V4](https://ozzmaker.com/product/berrygps-imu). You can also obtain different GPS hats which might be already compatible with this software (look at GPS hat drivers in "./libs/gps" directory).
3. External GPS Antenna - GPS/GNSS Magnetic Mount Antenna - 3m (SMA)
4. SMA GPS Connector. 
5. ZTE MF833V 4G LTE USB Modem Dongle for data.
6. Pi Case 
7. Pi Touchscreen 7inch.
   
### Touchscreen Device with smaller screen
